2025-11-02 OTC self-care smoke test:
- Served the static site with `python -m http.server 8000` (npm-hosted `http-server` was blocked by registry policy).
- Loaded the `OTC - Cold relief supply`, `OTC - Diarrhoea rehydration`, and `OTC - Macrogol plan` scenarios to confirm multi-select intake controls populate correctly and produce the expected supply or referral outcomes.
- Observed the rule library panel now lists an "Intake structure" summary for each pack and reflected multi-select question types.
- Confirmed manifest signature verification succeeded in-browser (no console errors while loading signed packs).

2025-11-02 Mobile overflow regression check:
- Served the static site locally with `python -m http.server 8000` and loaded it in a Playwright iPhone 12 viewport.
- Confirmed `overflow-x` reports `hidden` for both `html` and `body` and the document `scrollWidth` equals the viewport width, eliminating lateral panning.
- Verified vertical scrolling remains available (`scrollHeight` exceeded the viewport height), ensuring normal page progression on mobile.
